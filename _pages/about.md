Our lab uses advanced probabilistic AI models to solve complex immunological puzzles.

We focus on establishing **causal**{: style="color:#EC6524"} links between genes and cell states. We apply key concepts from causal learning to go beyond correlations.

For this we use a **systems**{: style="color:#04A2A7"} perspective. Modern perturbational datasets give unique problems for inference and statistics, meaning we push the frontier of deep probabilistic models and amortization. A true dream for any aspiring machine learner.

We apply this on urgent problems in **immunology**{: style="color:#6A3B91"}, such as immune cell homeostasis, inflammation and oncology.
