  abstract = {Reprogramming often yields heterogeneous cell fates, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address this, we developed single-cell transcription factor sequencing (scTF-seq), a single-cell technique that induces barcoded, doxycycline-inducible TF overexpression and quantifies TF dose-dependent transcriptomic changes. Applied to mouse embryonic multipotent stromal cells, scTF-seq generated a gain-of-function atlas for 384 mouse TFs, identifying key regulators of lineage specification, cell cycle control and their interplay. Leveraging single-cell resolution, we uncovered how TF dose shapes reprogramming heterogeneity, revealing both dose-dependent and stochastic cell state transitions. We classified TFs into low-capacity and high-capacity groups, with the latter further subdivided by dose sensitivity. Combinatorial scTF-seq demonstrated that TF interactions can shift from synergistic to antagonistic depending on the relative dose. Altogether, scTF-seq enables the dissection of TF function, dose and cell fate control, providing a high-resolution framework to understand and predict reprogramming outcomes, advancing gene regulation research and the design of cell engineering strategies.},

  abstract = {Gene regulation is inherently multiscale, but scale-adaptive machine learning methods that fully exploit this property in single-nucleus accessibility data are still lacking. Here, we develop ChromatinHD, a pair of scale-adaptive models that uses the raw accessibility data, without peak-calling or windows, to link regions to gene expression and determine differentially accessible chromatin. We show how ChromatinHD consistently outperforms existing peak and window-based approaches and find that this is due to a large number of uniquely captured, functional accessibility changes within and outside of putative cis-regulatory regions. Furthermore, ChromatinHD can delineate collaborating regulatory regions, including their preferential genomic conformations, that drive gene expression. Finally, our models also use changes in ATAC-seq fragment lengths to identify dense binding of transcription factors, a feature not captured by footprinting methods. Altogether, ChromatinHD, available at https://chromatinhd.org, is a suite of computational tools that enables a data-driven understanding of chromatin accessibility at various scales and how it relates to gene expression.},

Although more than 70 trajectory inference tools have already been developed, it is challenging to compare their performance because the input they require and output models they produce vary substantially. Here, we benchmark 45 of these methods on 110 real and 229 synthetic datasets for cellular ordering, topology, scalability and usability. Our results highlight the complementarity of existing tools, and that the choice of method should depend mostly on the dataset dimensions and trajectory topology. Based on these results, we develop a set of guidelines to help users select the best method for their dataset. Our freely available data and evaluation pipeline (https://benchmark.dynverse.org) will aid in the development of improved tools designed to analyze increasingly large and complex single-cell datasets.},

  abstract = {A critical step in the analysis of large genome-wide gene expression datasets is the use of module detection methods to group genes into co-expression modules. Because of limitations of classical clustering methods, numerous alternative module detection methods have been proposed, which improve upon clustering by handling co-expression in only a subset of samples, modelling the regulatory network, and/or allowing overlap between modules. In this study we use known regulatory networks to do a comprehensive and robust evaluation of these different methods. Overall, decomposition methods outperform all other strategies, while we do not find a clear advantage of biclustering and network inference-based approaches on large gene expression datasets. Using our evaluation workflow, we also investigate several practical aspects of module detection, such as parameter estimation and the use of alternative similarity measures, and conclude with recommendations for the further development of these methods.},
